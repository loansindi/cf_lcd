The goal of this repository is to develop a library for driving CrystalFontz serial character LCD modules (beginning with the CFA533 USB: https://www.crystalfontz.com/product/cfa533yyhku-16x2-usb-character-module-with-keypad - this should consequently simultaneously provide support for most features of the CFA633 as well).

Functionality is currently in very early stages.
